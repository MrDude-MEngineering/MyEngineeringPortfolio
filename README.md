I started 3D modeling in my junior year of high school, I went to a technical school that let us explore many fields of which I chose Engineering. The class in which was a little over 2 hours every school day, I learned many softwares such as AutoCAD, Autodesk Inventor, Autodesk Revit, RobotC, KUKA Programming, and a few more. Getting certified in AutoCAD, Autodesk Inventor, and Autodesk Revit. I have explored and have done projects over many specializations such as civil, mechanical, electrical, robotics, and a school year of architectural modeling in my senior year. I have designed things like the Polar Express, the Pixar Lamp, a DIY woodblock F1 car, a fully furnished house, a fully furnished 2 story commericial building, a snare drum, and several more unfinshed models such as a WIP scale model of a University's Main Campus. I have coded on programs for KUKA Robots, CNC Machining, and VEX Robots, making fully functional codes that would do certain things such as cutting a design to picking up and putting down an object from one place to another. Going to college currently 9/2/24 for B.S. in Mechanical Engineering so I will have more posted throughout my journey.
